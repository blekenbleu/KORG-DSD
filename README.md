DS-DAC-10R performs RIAA EQ and normalisation digitally, but [after converting from DSD to PCM (then back)](https://darko.audio/2016/07/portable-vinyl-with-the-korg-ds-dac-10r-audiogate/).  
- perhaps better to leave in PCM, compressing better and more compatible with Windows...  
- alternatively, use [an analog phono preamp](#schiit-mani-2) into DS-DAC-10R, allowing it to do one-time DSD ADC.
