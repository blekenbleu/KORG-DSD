Sometimes used for [cartridge comparisons](https://blekenbleu.github.io/SL-7/delta_T4P.htm)  
In retrospect, [E1DA Cosmos ADC](https://hifigo.com/products/e1da-cosmos-adc) is a better choice.

### [DS-DAC-10R Windows System Updater](https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/software/0/528/2625/)

### Activation

Either a KORG DS-DAC or MR series product is required to activate the AudioGate 4.  
Follow these steps to activate the software after installation.

#### Customers who purchased a KORG 1-bit product

1.  Connect the KORG 1-bit product to the computer where AudioGate 4 has been downloaded.
2.  Launch AudioGate 4 and the license confirmation procedure will take place automatically.  
    AudioGate 4 is now activated and ready for use.

  
_Alternatively_  

1.  Launch AudioGate 4 and the activation process will begin.
2.  Click the \[Activate\] button and the next screen will open.
3.  Connect the KORG 1-bit product to the computer.
4.  Click the \[Activate using KORG 1-bit product\] button.

The license confirmation procedure will take place automatically,  
and AudioGate 4 will be activated and ready for use.  
Once you activate AudioGate 4, you don't need to connect devices again to startup. However,  
if the computer where it is installed changes, AudioGate 4 will need activation once again.  
  
NOTE: Although usually required only once, reactivation may needed occasionally,  
depending on the computer configuration.

DS-DAC-10R performs RIAA EQ and normalisation digitally, but [after converting from DSD to PCM (then back)](https://darko.audio/2016/07/portable-vinyl-with-the-korg-ds-dac-10r-audiogate/).  
- perhaps better to leave in PCM, compressing better and more compatible with Windows...  
- alternatively, use [an analog phono preamp](#schiit-mani-2) into DS-DAC-10R, allowing it to do one-time DSD ADC.

LED seems unnecessarily bright; chunky wall-wart transformer hogs spaces on an outlet strip  
Mani got warm within minutes of power on, but ran cooler several hours later...?  
Configured DS-DAC-10R for line in and no equalization,  
moved SL-7 wiring from it to Mani with default settings,  
Mano output level with A-T cartridge shipped in SL-7 seems fine in AudioGate,  
which seemingly only plays from DS-DAC-10R when Record button is selected.  
No obvious treble boost with stock SL-7 phono cables and default Mani loading settings.  

### Wave Corrector usage with DS-DAC-10-R
- Wave Corrector is null comparison for rendered music  

1. Practiced struggling with [Wave Corrector](https://blekenbleu.github.io/SL-7/WaveCorrector.html) on Baez' "Diamonds and Rust" side 2;  
Wave Corrector is too eager to split tracks on dramatic singing pauses;
	- split threshold is no longer adjustable, `Tips.txt` includes using  
		- Block - Merge Tracks command to remerge false tracks to a single track.
2. [Korg DS-DAC-10-R is already tested by Multitone Loopback](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/beta-test-multitone-loopback-analyzer-software.27844/post-1284540)  

3. Windows has an embedded limiter (CAudioLimiter) [APO](https://github.com/dechamps/APO) that can cause distortion if the signal is near full scale
	- use ASIO or WASAPI exclusive and bypass Windows' audio engine all together, for bit perfect operation.
	- Equalizer APO (EAPO) supports a trouble shooting mode that [turns off all "original" (stock) system APOs](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ending-the-windows-audio-quality-debate.19438/)  
4. ADC alternatives  
    - [E1DA Cosmos ADC](https://hifigo.com/products/e1da-cosmos-adc) is a better choice.
    - [MOTU M4](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/motu-m4-audio-interface-review.15757/) cost-effective USB ADC with known better specs.
	- [$550 MOTU UltraLite-mk5](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/motu-ultralite-mk5-review-audio-interface.24777/) has better ADC and multi-channel.  
	- [perfectionist perspective](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/which-adc-for-phono-signal-into-s-p-dif-or-toslink.43262/post-1532862)  
		- 20dB for pops and clicks
		- add 80dB for music = 100dB
		- ADC achieving more than 100db SINAD is a challenge  

### Wave Corrector and [Multitone Loopback](https://distortaudio.org/multitone.html)  &nbsp; <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/beta-test-multitone-loopback-analyzer-software.27844/">beta testing</a>
- Multitone Loopback uses known simpler waveforms for e.g. distortion distortion testing  
  Harmonic and intermodulation distortion are traditional measures for nonlinearity;  
  modern high sampling speed ADCs could presumably perform linearity measurements more directly...  
- Seemingly, Wave Corrector and Multitone Loopback tech could be combined for phonograph analyses
	- rip test records known to employ constant amplitude sine wave sweeps
    - deduce those frequencies and synchronize synthesized sine sweep to rip
    - calculate SINAD and distortions;&nbsp; generate linearization and equalization corrections
