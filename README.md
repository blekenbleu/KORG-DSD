    "With the clamp removed and used with the same EPC-P540 cartridge in the J3 and SL7, the SL7 now sounds  
    just as fast and dynamic as the J3, but with much fuller tonality and no synthetic feeling whatsoever."

Technics [_dominated_ the tangential (linear tracking) tonearm turntable market](https://vintagetechnics.audio/turntables.php#ddlt);  
their cover-attached tonearm design is vulnerable to airborne microphonics,  
but servo-driven tonearms benefit from relatively good damping at the carriage.  
Instead of setting up standing waves by reflections from pivots relatively rigid against all but rotation,  
arm vibrations transmitted through cartridge from stylus tracing are more quickly absorbed.

Well packed, clean and intact;  plays fine, cartridge emphasizes sibilances.

    ### discussion
    
    A tracking angle error of no more than 0.1% is claimed, but tracking errors may be less problematic  
    than stylus rake angle, which may [vary among LP cutters ± 5 from 92 degree ideal](https://www.gcaudio.com/tips-tricks/cartridge-alignment-the-basics-explained/).  
    [![](https://www.theanalogdept.com/images/spp6_pics/Alignment_FAQ/TAD_sra_vta_1.gif)](https://www.theanalogdept.com/)  
    [Listening tests report that vertical tracking changes of 1/30 of a degree audibly affect music clarity.](https://www.gcaudio.com/images/uploads/VTA_article.pdf) ![](tracking.jpg)  
      
    Any number of imagined audible artifacts are associated with tracking and rake angle errors, but:
*   Phono styli cantilevers are relatively short;  small deflections provoke relatively large angle changes.
*   Record warp and tracking force impact rake angle, working against tonearm effective mass and damping.
*   [Rake angle error](https://pspatialaudio.com/vertical_tracking_error.htm) effectively applies [box filtering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/box-filter) to groove modulations, particularly with line contact styli.
*   Record eccentricity (off-center hole) provokes lateral stylus deflection and dynamic tracking angle error.
*   Tracking angle errors change phase between left and right stereo channels, impacting spatial perception.  
      
    Second-generation Technics linear-tracking turntables included larger SL-DL1 and SL-Q4 models along with the SL-7, with the SL-Q4 sharing SL-7's quartz-phase-lock controlled direct drive platter and boron cantilever.  
    Its arm servo control reportedly improved on the original SL-10 linear tracker,  
    Technics moving coil cartridge model, offered longer than this second generation, perhaps with updated arm servo?  
    The SL-15 had added random track selection programming to the SL-10, while replacing its moving coil with the  
    [EPC-205C MK3 moving magnet cartridge with ultra low mass stylus](https://vintagesonics.com/reviews/turntables/cartridges/technics-epc-205c-mk3-review/), also used in the SL-7 and SL-Q4.  
    Gimmicky record clamp disappeared in subsequent generations of LP cover size turntables,  
    which shared chassis and covers among models and dropped boron cantilevers.  
    That SL-Q4 was a 1 year wonder, being replaced by the [well-regarded SL-QL1](https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?t=13109).  
    Weirdly, by 1983 some cheaper linear tracking models (e.g. SL-J11 and SL-L20) were belt-driven.  
    By 1986, some cartridges were sourced from Audio Technica.  
      
    Despite general dismissal of Technics linear-tracking turntables by audiophiles,  
    many reviewers conceded that they are good at tracking warped records.  
    Tracking force by spring instead of mass contributes to low effective tonearm mass, reducing styli vertical excursions. Lack of antiskating force helps lateral alignment, and smaller vertical deflections reduce styli box filtering effects.

    *   [_Triophile_](https://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?t=2678):  "The achilles heel of the SL-10 and SL-15 is noise breakthrough from the arm drive motor, which,  
        although inaudible (to my cloth ears) at normal listening distance, is sometimes audible through headphones.  
        Technics eliminated this flaw in the SL-7, which has better immunity to external vibration too."

        only Super have different generators;  OM line contact styli are now rare.
    *   A-T seems the last T4P offering full SL-7 compatibility and available line contact styli.
