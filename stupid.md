### stupid things about AudioGate4
- grabs both input and output for selected device with exclusive access
   - preventing monitoring AudioGate4 recording from another device
   - making it impossible for Windows to play from DS-DAC-10R
     while AudioGate uses it for input.  
		- despite [Control Panel Sound settings](control.md)  
			- [work-around using Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro](control.md#audiogate4-stupidity-dsd-playback-work-around-using-creative-sound-blaster-x-fi-surround-51-pro)
			- another possible work-around: [**VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device**](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)  
- most menu items duplicate icons
  - one of the few that is not and among the more important, `preferences`,
    is buried 2 levels deep
  - settings are scattered among several panels
    DSD / PCM file formats, bit rates, input/output devices and channels, etc
  - no selection for recording PCM instead of DSD??
- AudioGate4 can playback to [Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1](https://en.creative.com/p/sound-cards/sound-blaster-x-fi-surround-5-1-pro)
 and be heard from its headphone jack,  
  but this X-Fi *fails* as Windows Input Device without [specific Control Panel settings](control.md).
- AudioGate4 also can playback to [AudioBox USB](https://www.presonus.com/products/AudioBox-USB),  
  but AudioBox then no longer works for Windows Input..!  
- AudioGate4 `help` links to an obsolete Japanese document.  
- **How did AudioGate4 ever get favorable reviews???**
