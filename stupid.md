### stupid things about AudioGate4
- grabs both input and output for selected device with exclusive access
   - making it impossible for Windows to play from that device
     while AudioGate uses it for input.
   - preventing AudioGate4 from monitoring recording to another device
- most menu items duplicate icons
  - one of the few that is not and among the more important, `preferences`,
    is buried 2 levels deep
  - settings are scattered among several panels
    DSD / PCM file formats, bit rates, input/output devices and channels, etc
  - no selection for recording PCM instead of DSD??
- AudioGate4 can playback to the X-Fi and be heard from its headphone,
  but X-Fi fails as Windows Input Device.
- AudioGate4 also can playback to the AudioBox,  
  but it then no longer works for Windows Input..!  
- **How did it ever get favorable reviews???**
